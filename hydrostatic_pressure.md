# What is Hydrostatic Pressure?

As the name itself suggests, hydrostatic pressure is the pressure exerted by a fluid (at rest) at equillibrium due to force of gravity.

## Properties of Hydrostatic Pressure

1. Acts at a right angle to the surface of the container holding the fluid

1. It is exerted in all directions equally to the sides of the container

## Quanitfying Hydrostatic Pressure

We know that Pressure is force exerted on unit area,

1. P = Force / Area

and similarly, Force is the product of mass and acceleration

1. F = mass * acceleration

in our case, acceleration is the acceleration due to gravity i.e.,g, hence the equation can be modified as,

1. F = mass * (acceleration due to gravity)

symbolically, F = m *  g and P = F / A

Also we consider Density of the liquid which is the product of mass and volume,

1. Density = mass * Volume

*upon combining the above  equations, we get*

 P = r * g * h

where P = pressure, r (rho) = specific gravity of the fluid, g = accelration due to gravity and h = height of the fluid

### Why calculate the height of the fluid?
  
 * If we know the specific gravity of the fluid and the pressure exerted by the liquid we can calculate the maximum height of the fluid 
 that can be allowed.

 * We can avoid the occurence of any hazardous effects in the surroundings or to the equipemnt itself.

 The height can be calculated as

 h = P / (r * g)
